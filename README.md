# Classical-Localization-Code
+ This file includes the code of classical localization simulation code in MATLAB, like WKNN, KNN and naive Bayesian inference.
+ The file named 'ReceiveFun.m' conducts the multi-path loss model simulations. 
$$P_r [dBm]=P_0+10nlog{\frac{d}{d_0}}+n_0$$
And the noise settings should be referred to 3GPP.
+ The file named 'FingerLocFun.m' conducts the specific code of different methods.
+ The 'main.m' file should be set to run the fingerprint sampling process and generate the final results.
